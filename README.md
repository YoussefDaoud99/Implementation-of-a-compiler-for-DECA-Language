### Context

**Projet g√©nie logiciel** is one of the biggest projects that was done in my training at Grenoble INP - Ensimag. This project is done in a team of five people in full time work for one month.

The software engineering project consists in **implementing in Java a compiler for the Deca language** (a small language resembling Java). In addition, we developed a mathematical library in Deca language which brings together four trigonometric functions namely sine, cosine, arcsine and arctangent. Our implementation was developed in such a way to optimize the error as well as the calculation time of these functions.
